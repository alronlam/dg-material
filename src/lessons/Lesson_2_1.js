    "<b><i>The Original Sin: Where it all started</i></b><br/>" +
    "Shortly after the story of the world began, man falls into sin. The Serpent (who we later learn to be the Devil in the flesh -- see Revelation 12:9) came into the scene, deceiving the Woman (and Adam who was right there with her into disobeying a direct command from God (Genesis 3:6): the command not to eat of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. From then on, sin reigned over man and all creation. <br/>" +

    "<h3>OPEN WORD</h3>" +
    "<b><i>Genesis 3:16-19</i></b><br/>" +
    "16To the woman he said,“I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be contrary to[a] your husband, but he shall rule over you.” 17And to Adam he said “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you,‘You shall not eat of it,’ cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life, 18thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.19By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>Genesis 2:17</i></b><br/>" +
    "17but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "As consequence, God curses the man, the woman and the serpent: painful work for man (3:17-19), pain in childbirth for the woman (3:16), and relationship struggles between each other (3:16) and death for both (2:17, 3:19). But sin’s consequences came with way more damage than it seems. Now, we’ll be looking at how sin has damaged man’s relationship with God.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>Sin damaged man’s relationship with God and brought death</i></b><br/>" +
    "After Adam and Eve’s sin, we then see them scrambling for ways to hide themselves from God’s presence (see Genesis 3:7-8, 10). As soon as they heard God walking in the garden, the two started displaying behaviour that proved their relationship with Him was not the way it used to be. Immediately, there was a gap in between man and God – a gap of fear, guilt and shame. This was because deep inside, they know that disobedience is fundamentally a distrust in God’s goodness and love. We know this ourselves, and feel this too in our own experience.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "They did not trust God’s word, choosing rather to gain knowledge of good and evil the wrong way.They disobeyed God, transgressing God’s command of not eating the forbidden fruit rather than enjoying the other fruits and vegetation which God has made available. By doing so, they have started to side against God, entertaining thoughts of rebellion against the One who created them and everything else for their enjoyment. When God came to confront them, they felt so afraid and ashamed that all they could do was hide their guilty faces. Same happens with us: the guilt from sin separates us from God’s holy presence.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "Nowadays, we consider death as “normal.” We are all bound to die from the day we were born.  That’s because death came with the sin and its curse (Genesis 2:17; also see Romans 6:23). Although God is merciful enough to not let them die immediately, as everyone might have expected, Adam and Eve, cut off from the Source and Author of life, has earned nothing but death and destruction because of their sin.<br/>" +
