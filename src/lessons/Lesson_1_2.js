    "Have you experienced being expected by your family to do something or be someone in order to represent them? <br/>" +

    "<h3>OPEN WORD</h3>" +
    "Humanity is made in God’s image -- both male and female (Genesis 1:26-27). To be an “image” of someone means to be a representative or representation of them. We see in Genesis that Adam and Eve were created by God to be the ones to show to the world who God is and what He is like. So we, human beings, are like God, though not fully, but only to some degree, and yet truly. This has a lot of important implications for us today. Here are a few of them:<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>Image of God: unique to humans</i></b><br/>" +
    "We, human beings, are special and above any creature or created thing. None of the animals or plants, or rocks or mountains, or stars or heavenly bodies, or any other of the things created -- no matter how wonderful they are -- are said to be created in His very image. Only humans have the unique privilege (and responsibility) of “imaging forth” God’s glory in that very special way. This makes human life utterly precious, and to be treated with much care and respect. This is also why God hates murder (see Genesis 9:6; see also 4:10).<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>Image of God in man means rule over creation</i></b><br/>" +
    "We, human beings, are meant to rule the earth for God (Genesis 1:28-29). God is, of course, King of all, but He has delegated to us some degree of authority to be like lesser kings of the earth. This means we are God’s stewards of creation. God set things in proper order, and we exist to keep it that way, and use God’s creation in a responsible and fruitful manner.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>Image of God in man means responsibility</i></b><br/>" +
    "We, human beings, have a special assignment or role from God, which renders us responsible for our actions and accountable to the One whose image our lives are supposed to portray. Because of this, we face judgement at the end of our lives in this present age, according to whether we have done well or not (see Hebrews 9:27).<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>Image of God in man’s family life</i></b><br/>" +
    "One very particular thing our being made in God’s image and likeness implies is that as the Creator creates, we also, as creatures, procreate. We multiply our own kind (see Genesis 5:3). Starting, building and supporting a family is one of the focuses of being human. The leadership of Adam as the man and the support of Eve as a woman, working together within the covenant of marriage, are at the very foundation of the family (see Genesis 2:18-25).<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>Image of God in man’s work life</i></b><br/>" +
    "Another is the mandate to “work the ground” (see Genesis 2:5). Since we are stewards, then work is something normal and expected of us. We live to work, not so just to extend our lives, but to imitate the God who Himself works. Laziness and idleness, therefore, have no place in God’s purpose for man. " +
    "This is God’s original purpose and design for humanity, and God makes this known to Adam and Eve. <br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>Jesus, God’s perfect image</i></b><br/>" +
    "Christ is the very radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of His nature -- indeed, God’s perfect image (see Hebrews 1;3). When Jesus Christ came, we also find the beginning of a new creation (see 2 Corinthians 5:17), and, therefore, being in union with Him brings a restoration of the image of God in man, as it was damaged by sin. <br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<h3>LIVE OUT</h3>" +
    "Since we have become new creation in Christ, we can now image forth God’s “excellencies” as we live a life of worship. Give three (3) ways you can display God’s image in your:<br/>" +
    "<ul>"+
    "<li>Family</li><br/>" +
    "<li>Work and aspirations</li><br/>" +
    "<li>Stewardship of possessions (money, talent, time, etc.)</li><br/>"+
    "</ul>"
