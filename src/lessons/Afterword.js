"The people of this present world are groping for something that will make sense of life. As Christians, it is our duty to show the world that the Christian faith is more than a private belief, more than personal salvation. We must show that it is a comprehensive life system that answers all of humanity’s age-old questions: Where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going? Does life have any meaning and purpose?" +
"<br/><br/>" +

"Christianity offers the only viable, rationally defensible answers to these questions. Only Christianity offers a way to understand both the physical and the moral order. Only Christianity offers a comprehensive worldview that covers all areas of life and thought, every aspect of creation. Only Christianity offers a way to live in line with the real world." +
"<br/><br/>"  +

"But if Christians are going to carry this life-giving message to the world, we must first understand it and live it ourselves. We must understand that God’s revelation is the source of <i>all truth</i>, a comprehensive framework for all of reality. Abraham Kuyper, the great nineteenth-century theologian who served as prime minister of Holland, said that the dominating principle of Christian truth is not soteriological (i.e., justification by faith) but rather cosmological (i.e., the sovereignty of the triune God over the whole cosmos, in all its spheres and kingdoms, visible and invisible). The entire cosmos can be understood only in relation to God." +
"<br/><br/>" +

"The church’s singular failure in recent decades has been the failure to see Christianity as a life system, or worldview, that governs every area of existence. This failure has been crippling in many ways. For one thing, we cannot answer the questions our children bring home from school, so we are incapable of preparing them to answer the challenges they face. For ourselves, we cannot explain to our friends and neighbors why we believe, and we often cannot defend our faith. And we do not know how to organize our lives correctly, allowing our choices to be shaped by the world around us. What’s more, by failing to see Christian truth in every aspect of life, we miss great depths of beauty and meaning: the thrill of seeing God’s splendor in the intricacies of nature or hearing his voice in the performance of a great symphony or detecting his character in the harmony of a well-ordered community." +
"<br/><br/>" +

"Most of all, our failure to see Christianity as a comprehensive framework of truth has crippled our efforts to have a redemptive effect on the surrounding culture. At its most fundamental level, the so-called culture war is a clash of belief systems. It is, as Kuyper put it, a clash of principle against principle, of worldview against worldview. Only when we see this can we effectively evangelize a post-Christian culture, bringing God’s righteousness to bear in the world around us." +
"<br/><br/>" +

"Evangelism and cultural renewal are both divinely ordained duties. God exercises his sovereignty in two ways: through <i>saving grace</i> and <i>common grace</i>. We are all familiar with saving grace; it is the means by which God’s power calls people who are dead in their trespasses and sins to new life in Christ. As God’s servants, we may at times be agents of his saving grace, evangelizing and bringing people to Christ. But few of us really understand common grace, which is the means by which God’s power sustains creation, holding back the sin and evil that result from the Fall and that would otherwise overwhelm his creation like a great flood. As agents of God’s common grace, we are called to help sustain and renew his creation, to uphold the created institutions of family and society, to pursue science and scholarship, to create works of art and beauty, and to heal and help those suffering from the results of the Fall." +
"<br/><br/>" +

"Because we wanted to communicate a fuller sense of how we cooperate with God’s common grace, Nancy Pearcey and I felt compelled to write this book. Our goal is to equip believers to present Christianity as a total worldview and life system, and to seize the opportunity of the new millennium to be nothing less than God’s agents in building a new Christian culture." +
"<br/><br/>" +

"To that end, we seek to explain what we mean by the term worldview, why it is important, and how to develop the skills to “think christianly” about all of life. We also look at the contours of a Christian worldview: first, the <i>creation</i> of both the universe and human life; second, the <i>fall</i> into sin and how it marred God’s good creation; and third, how God has provided a means of <i>redemption</i>." +
"<br/><br/>" +

"We believe the basic worldview principles—creation, fall, redemption—must be applied to the restoration of culture. We believe we can use these principles as tools not only to critique the false worldviews holding sway today but also to build a new culture. Examining everything from politics to education to the arts, we see examples of the way the Christian worldview provides a more coherent and rational way of living in the world— examples that provide a rough blueprint for living out a biblical worldview and renewing the culture in whichever arena of life God has placed us." +
"<br/><br/>" +

"These categories provide the means to compare and contrast the various ideas and philosophies competing for allegiance in today’s world, for they cover the central questions that any worldview must answer:" +
"<ol>" +
	"<li>" + "Creation—Where did we come from, and who are we?" +"</li>" + 
	"<li>" + "Fall—What has gone wrong with the world?" +"</li>" + 
	"<li>" + "Redemption—What can we do to fix it?" +"</li>" +
"</ol>" +


"This method of analysis is indispensable, for it will enable each of us to discern and defend the truth of what we believe. For Christianity is, after all, a reasonable faith, solidly grounded in human experience. It provides a worldview that fits the structure of reality and enables us to live in harmony with that structure." +
"<br/><br/>" +

"Is there yet time in this epic moment, at the dawn of the third millennium, to revive the church’s sense of hope and to bear witness to the immutable truth of biblical revelation? Can a culture be rebuilt so that all the world can see in its splendor and glory the contours of God’s kingdom? Emphatically yes. Pope John Paul II has urged Christians everywhere to work to make the new millennium a “springtime” of Christianity. We can indeed make the year 2000 the beginning of a new season for the faith." +
"<br/><br/>" +

"For that to happen, however, we must first listen to the answer God gave his people when they cried out, “How should we then live?” Through the prophet Ezekiel, God admonished his people to repent—turn <i>from</i> their evil ways and turn <i>toward</i> him—and to show their neighbors that their hope was in his justice and righteousness." +
"<br/><br/>" +


"God’s word to us today is precisely the same. And to unfold what obedience to that word means, we begin our journey in an unlikely place, among unlikely people, where you will first descend into hell and later catch a glimpse of heaven. Our opening story reveals the pattern by which we must redeem the world around us." +

"This is an excerpt of the introduction to the book How Now Shall We Live by Charles Colson and Nancy Pearcey. We believe the thoughts and exhortations of Colson and Pearcey in the said book are directly in line with the major ideas and principles behind this discipleship material; and reading this excerpt (even the whole book, for that matter) would be beneficial to anyone who would want to “dig a little deeper.” Though chunks of a considerable amount of content were cut to suit our purposes, the editing done did not in any way alter the authors’ general intent. Editing also included a rearrangement of words to maintain fluency of thought, and replacement of a couple of words here and there to contextualize the piece of writing to a more general/broader audience. (The introduction was originally written against the backdrop of Western/North-American events and culture, hence directly and explicitly addressed Americans as its immediate readers.) All italicizations in the excerpt are the authors’."
