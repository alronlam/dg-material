"[12] The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.” " +
"<br/><br/>" +

"<b><i>Read Genesis 3:16b</i></b>" +
"<br/>" +
"[16] To the woman he said," + "<br/>"+
    "...Your desire shall be contrary to your husband," + "<br/>"+
    "but he shall rule over you.”" + "<br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 7:14-20</i></b>" +
"<br/>" + 
"[14] For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. [15] For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. [16] Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. [17] So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. [18] For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. [19] For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. [20] Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me." +

"Sin can somehow be likened to a computer virus. The way a virus acts is that it invades and spreads into a system and confuses it, even to the point of self-destruction. We, like virus-infected computers, are broken and in need of some serious, soul-deep repairing. It is then the sin that lives in us that continues to lead us to hurt ourselves and others. <br/>" +
"<br/>" +
"<b><i>Sin damaged man’s relationship with man.</i></b><br/>" +
"Because of the “virus” of sin, man (though remaining to be a creature in the image of God) has been having trouble living in line with his Creator’s design and purpose. We can see this “dysfunction” affect man’s relationship with others (interpersonal) and man’s relationship with himself (intrapersonal).<br/>" +
"<br/>" +
"<b><i>Relationship with others (interpersonal).</i></b><br/>" +
"Adam’s gut response to God when He confronted him was, “The woman you gave to me, she gave me the fruit.” There’s now an obvious rift in Adam and Eve’s relationship, so that blame-shifting became an automatic reaction. The curse against Eve also shows this relationship struggle (see Genesis 3:16b).<br/>" +
"<br/>" +
"Here we also see the small but dreadful beginnings of hatred between persons. In fact, men’s sinful aggression towards each other snowballed so fast that we see the very first murder happen in the very next chapter (see Genesis 4:1-16). From then on, stories of indifference, hate, taking advantage of others, and other sinful things people do to each other continued to abound wherever human life spread — chapter after chapter, story after story. This is obviously still true to this day.<br/>" +
"<br/>" +
"<b><i>Relationship with self (intrapersonal relationship).</i></b><br/>" +
"We also find man not only struggling to be at peace with others, but also having difficulty being at peace with himself. In the story, we see how personal shame and guilt started taking over Adam and Eve (see Genesis 3:7-8, 10). Eventually, man loses full control of himself and his ways, with sin taking the driver’s seat of the inner being. <br/>" +
"<br/>" +
"Sin, to this day, continues to hijack our humanness, our thoughts, our desires, our actions. So, the “self” somehow has become a divided being, as though one person has two conflicting identities. The Apostle Paul perfectly describes this inner struggle caused by sin in Romans 7:<br/>" +
"<br/>" +
"“For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate…For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.” (Romans 7:15, 18b-19)<br/>" +
"<br/>" +
"Sin now lives inside of every human being, even when they are still in the womb (see Psalm 51:5). This is what has been called “indwelling sin” and has led to what’s called man’s “sinful nature.”<br/>" +

"<ul>" +
"<li>Reflect on how the “virus” of sin has somehow been at work in your relationships (family, friends, love life, etc.).</li>" +
