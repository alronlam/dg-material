		"<b>Open Word</b> is the “gist” of the lesson. This is where the feasting in the Word of God happens. Carefully go through the verses and paragraphs, and make sure you stop to open your Bible whenever it says “see” certain passages of Scripture." +

	"<li>" +
		"<b>Live Out</b> simply focuses on life application. Disciples must be doers, not just hearers, the Apostle James says. This is where the study engages with the practical reality of everyday Christian living, basically reflecting on this question: How can these things apply to my life? Don’t just learn it; live it out." +
