    "How do you usually make up for your shortcomings or failures?<br/>" +

    "<h3>OPEN WORD</h3>" +
    "We find the the promised redeemer in the person of Jesus, but so far, in the story of Redemption, we haven’t yet seen how exactly He accomplishes this victory. However, there are clues in the Genesis episode.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>The consequence: shame and guilt</i></b><br/>" +
    "Let’s go back to the events right after the Original Sin. God came to the garden to confront the humans, His stewards. Now, knowing that God will be confronting them, Adam and Eve had sewn fig leaves into loincloths to cover their nakedness (see Genesis 3:7). This is an act showing their feelings of fear, guilt and shame. For some reason they just felt that they had to cover themselves... or else something wrong would happen.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "You see, God is a holy God. It is only reasonable for and expected of Him to utterly hate and punish sin (see Habakkuk 1:14). And so when Adam and Eve sinned, they instinctively knew they were headed for a head-on collision with God’s righteous wrath. Out of fear, they could only hide behind their garment of leaves.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>The Old Covenant: sacrificial system</i></b><br/>" +
    "So, the fig trees were supposed to work, or so they thought. But they didn’t, and it seems that God didn’t care at all about their leafy loincloths… except for one thing. He changed them with something much better: garments made of animal skin (see Genesis 3:21). <br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "Now, making garments out of animal skin implies that an animal would have to be killed first. So here we see the first instance of animal sacrifice in the Bible. God cared so much for Adam and Eve in that while they are now considered sinful and unworthy of God’s kindness, God still clothes them, yet not without requiring a sacrifice.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "Look closer, and see: Isn’t this the same concept found in the Jew’s sacrificial system? Through Moses, God commanded that Israelites operate within an intricate system of sacrifices, because by it they kept themselves ritually pure and worthy before the covenant-keeping God, through atonement of their sins by animal blood. This we know to be the Law of the Old Covenant.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<b><i>The New Covenant: saving sacrifice</i></b><br/>" +
    "Read Hebrews 10:1, 4, 5, 9-10:<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "[1] For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. <br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "[4] For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "[5] Consequently, when Christ came into the world,...<br/>" +
    "\t<br/>" +
    "[8] When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), [9] then he added, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. [10] And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "In the New Covenant (the “second” covenant), we find the deeper meaning behind these stuff about sacrifices and atonement. The New Covenant brings a far better, far more real, and far more effective way of being atoned for and forgiven in the sight of God: through the sacrificial blood of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God (see John 1:29). All this Old Testament way of sacrifices and being ritually holy, being mere “shadows of the good things to come,” are just pointing everyone to the One who will truly, once and for all, bring holiness and forgiveness through His death on the Cross.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "Though Adam and Eve might have not understood this fully, God, by clothing them with animal skin, wanted them to see that through the sacrifice of One, their sin -- and the sins of the whole world -- will finally be dealt with, and they will be clothed with righteousness and glory, and so will be fully welcomed again by God in His presence. This is God’s grace, His redemption introduced.<br/>" +
    "<br/>" +
    "<h3>LIVE OUT</h3>" +
    "“Let us...” Hebrews 10 concludes the discussion of Christ’s atoning sacrifice with three commands of “let us...”<br/>" +
    "<ul>" +
    "<li>Let us draw near with confidence to the presence of God (vv19-22). Talk about the last time you drew near to God in prayer or personal quiet time.</li>" +
    "<li>Let us hold fast to our hope without wavering (V23). What things in your life make your hope in God waver or weaken? </li>" +
    "<li>Let us consider to stir up one another to love and good works (v24-25). Give ways in which you can practice love and good works to (1) fellow believers and (2) unbelievers.</li>" +
    "</ul>"
