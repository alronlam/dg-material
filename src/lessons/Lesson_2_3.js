    "Share a travel experience you had where you were able to see the wonders of God’s creation. \n" +

    "OPEN WORD:\n" +
    "As God’s representatives, bearer’s of His image and stewards of creation on His behalf, man and woman were not the only ones affected by the Fall. Even the rest of creation suffers the consequences of sin. Originally, God called His creation “very good,” but as sin came God Himself cursed it (“the ground”) so that it brings suffering and pain to all its inhabitants. We can then say that we currently live in a fallen, broken world.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Creation was subjected to futility\n" +
    "Paul, in Romans 8:20-22, tells us the “story behind the story,” what happened to God’s creation because of sin, and what it meant.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "20For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope 21that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. 22For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. (Romans 8:20–22)\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Sin damages man’s relationship with the rest of God’s creation\n" +
    "Creation, or nature, as it is often called, started to malfunction.Though God created the world in glory and order, sin came in and brought disruption, death and decay. To this day, sin’s curse is still in effect, keeping God’s creation bound to corruption (see Romans 8:20), and so we suffer its continuous consequences in different ways, such as natural calamities and disasters like earthquakes, typhoons and tornadoes, floods, and the like. The earth used to be perfectly habitable for humans and animals; now, it has become a challenge for both to even survive it.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Work became difficult and painful\n" +
    "Originally, the ground, including all the trees and plant life that grow on it, would be Adam’s source of food, and thus source of life. However, as part of the curse, the ground and all its produce will make it significantly more difficult for humans’ life on earth. Fruits, crops and vegetation would still grow for man, but not after much difficulty and toil. Pain now will accompany man’s efforts to feed himself and sustain his and his family’s life. Man works hard and feeds to restore his strength, in order to continue the labor the next day; the cycle goes on until death. Work itself, though, is not a result nor a part of the curse, but painful work is.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Awaiting redemption...\n" +
    "Going back to Romans 8, we see this logic: As man, God’s designated head of creation, falls, so goes the rest of creation. Conversely, the only way creation will be set free from the bondage of the curse is that man be set free first. \n" +
    "\n" +
    "Creation itself knows this, and is groaning, says Paul. With each crushing tsunami, each movement of the tectonic plates underneath the ground, each boom of the thunderstorm, creation is wailing and bellyaching, as if in desperate anticipation of a saving act that will finally free it from bondage.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "LIVE OUT:\n" +
    "Share particular struggle/s in your life (personal, work, at home, etc.) and how you can be prayed for.\n"
