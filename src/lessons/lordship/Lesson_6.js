"<h3>LEAD ON</h3>" +
"Who are people in your life that you can say you can absolutely trust? Why is it so?"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Christ has won our salvation for us, and has freely given it to us who were chosen by grace. But how do we receive this salvation? How does it get from Jesus Christ (point A) to us (point B)? The Answer is Sola Fide—through faith alone. Yes, faith: that’s all it takes."+


"<h3>OPEN WORD</h3>" +
"<b><i>Read Romans 3:28</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[28] For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"As we have learned about God’s work of justification, God cannot justify sinners on the basis of works, but He can and he will justify us only on the basis of faith."+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Read Galatians 2:16</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[16] yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 5:1</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[1] Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>In Christ, by faith</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Having prepared for us a righteousness that is in Christ, God has also chosen to connect us to this righteousness by faith in Him. By trusting in the Lord Jesus for salvation, we become totally (100%) loved, welcomed and accepted by the Holy God."+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Read Romans 5:2</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[2] Through [Christ] we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Ephesians 2:8</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>By grace, through faith</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"To understand Sola Fide, we must also look at how it is so closely linked to Sola Gratia. This is because grace and faith work hand in hand:"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"By the merit of Jesus’ life, death and resurrection, a righteousness has now been earned—This is the role of grace."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"By believing or trusting in Jesus as Lord and Savior, the righteousness earned by Christ is in turn credited to our account—This is the role of faith."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"You see: Faith alone connects us to Christ and His righteousness—not performance or ancestry or denomination or religious group; not even church membership. But even faith is a “gift” from God, so that grace is still the ultimate means of salvation (Ephesians 2:8)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 4:4–5</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[4] Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due. [5] And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Not “faith + works”</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Unfortunately, the “default” mindset people have—sometimes even those who call themselves “Christian”—is that what Jesus did for them must be complemented by their own good works for them to be worthy of it. It’s like saying “Yeah. Jesus did it all for me. But I must still show an effort to gain it as my rightful wage.” Wrong. It is not Jesus’ merit + our own efforts = our salvation. It is His merit alone that credits to our benefit. And this “crediting” happens only through faith in Christ, putting complete trust in what He has already done for us. Therefore, we are made righteous in God’s sight through faith alone."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"It is very important to emphasize the word ‘alone,’ because it’s so easy to fall back into the pitfall of  “works salvation.” Again, people usually think that the way to gain acceptance is by performance. Yes. If you want something, you’ve got to work for it—yet, this doesn’t apply to salvation, because working for your own salvation is simply an impossibility. That’s why Someone had to work for it for you. The key to salvation is having faith in the One who has won it all for you."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Faith alone that works</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"If justification is by faith alone, then is there still any use for works? Why does a Christian have to do good works if faith alone is all that matters? The answer can be summarised in this famous statement: “We are saved by faith alone that does not remain alone.”"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"What this means is that, though God has begun a good work in us through faith alone, this faith then inevitably produces good works in our lives. Therefore, a “faith” that does not manifest in obedience to the Lord and good works is not a real faith. True faith—as it works in tandem with God’s grace—is faith that produces works (see Ephesians 2:8-10)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Faith is the “key,” while good works is its “keychain”</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"True, saving faith can be likened to a key—the one and only key—to unlock a door. Suppose there are many keys, and all these keys look pretty much alike or indistinguishable, so much so that they needed to have keychains. So, what you do is you attach a “special keychain” to the one true key, so you know which key is the one you need."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"See, now, how this picture corresponds to matters concerning salvation:"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"There’s only one true key (faith) to unlock the door (salvation), and it always comes with a special keychain (good works). You don’t use the keychain to unlock the door (you can’t use good works to gain salvation)! It was never meant to be used that way! But you use it to know which one is the true key (you can know true, saving faith because it always comes with good works)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Faith is more than just mentally “believing”</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Now, true faith is more than just mentally “believing,” more than just intellectually understanding and agreeing with certain doctrines. It doesn’t help if you think the Gospel is true if it doesn’t go down to your heart and doesn’t affect your life the way it should. If this is the kind of faith a person has, then it’s a fake kind of faith, and it cannot save. For example, if you say that your faith has led you to love Christ, and yet you do not love and serve His Church, then the genuineness of your faith is in question (see Galatians 5:6) . That’s just one example of so many other good things that can be considered “evidence” of having true, saving faith. But the simple fact is this: Your faith must come with evidence, or else it is not real at all in the first place—it’s “dead” (see James 2:17-27)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>The righteous is saved, and will continue to live, by faith</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Faith is seeing and submitting to the truth you have believed in. It’s a conviction that’s so certain and so compelling that commitment is sure to follow through to the finish line (see Hebrews 11:1 and 12:1). It’s seeing your neediness and poverty, and surrendering at the feet of the One who truly, fully satisfies (see John 6:35-40). And saving faith, as understood biblically, has Jesus Christ as its central object (see Acts 16:31; Mark 16:16; John 3:14-16). It all starts with faith in Christ alone, going on to living a life saturated by faith in the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit with every twist and turn, for the righteous shall live by faith (see Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11, Hebrews 10:38 and Habakkuk 2:4; also 2 Corinthians 5:7)."+

"<h3>LIVE OUT</h3>"+
"Think of areas in your life right now that push you to “stretch” your faith in the Lord. Are you taking on the challenge, or are you pulling away from the pressure?"
