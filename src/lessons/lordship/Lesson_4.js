"<h3>OPEN WORD</h3>" +
"<b><i>Read 1 Corinthians 15:1-3</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[1] Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, [2] and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. [3] For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Delivered as of first importance</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"The Gospel is the good news of salvation, the message of how God has made a way to forgive and justify us, and bring us back to Him. Now, it is of first importance (v3) to understand the Gospel message as correctly and clearly as possible. This is why in history the church had formulated doctrines and patterns of teaching to help preserve and defend the Gospel from false teachings or misconceptions of its truth. In this lesson, we’ll start talking about the doctrines called the “Five Solas.”"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"The Five Solas (sola/solus means “alone”) summarize the correct  explanation of the Gospel, particularly in the way we have been justified: in Christ alone (Solus Christus), by grace alone (Sola Gratia), through faith alone (Sola Fide), to the glory of God alone (Soli Deo Gloria), as taught in the Scriptures alone (Sola Scriptura)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Luke 24:25–27</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[25] And [Jesus] said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! [26] Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” [27] And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"At the center of the story and message of the Bible is Jesus Christ and His Gospel. A right understanding of who Christ is and what He has done is the foundation of our whole faith."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Now, at the very core of the Gospel, and the reason why all its basic truths hold together, is not just a doctrine, but a Person -- Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Without Him the Christian faith will not stand -- no, it won’t even exist in the first place. Without Christ, we remain guilty of our sins and condemned. Without Christ, there is no justification, no forgiveness, no salvation, no Bible and no Christianity. But in Christ we can rest assured that we are justified and forgiven, because His saving work is final and sufficient."+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Read John 19:30</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[30] When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, “It is finished,” and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Hebrews 9:25–28</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[25] Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, [26] for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. [27] And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, [28] so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 8:1</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[1] There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Christ’s saving work is final</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"It is final. There is no more condemnation in Christ (Romans 8:1). Our being justified in God’s eyes is based on Jesus Christ alone and His finished work of redemption.  The word ‘finished’ is essential, because being already finished -- having been accomplished “once and for all” -- it cannot be repeated, because it does not need to be. His atoning sacrifice happened for the forgiveness of sins in the past, at the present and in the future. We may come to God daily for forgiveness, but we are forgiven always only on the basis of what happened on the Cross 2,000 years ago."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Hebrews 10:10–12</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[10] And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. [11] And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. [12] But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Christ’s saving work is sufficient</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"It is sufficient. Jesus’ sacrifice was a single sacrifice, done once and for all time. No need for us to add to what Jesus has done for our redemption. So, we rely on Jesus alone because it is enough. It won’t make sense for us to try to win more of God’s favor for us to be worthy of His acceptance, because we are already 100% favored and accepted in Christ!"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read John 14:6</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[6] Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Salvation is exclusive in Christ</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"In this age of an “anything goes” philosophy and an “all roads lead to heaven” kind of spirituality, one important implication of Solus Christus is that Christ alone is the only way of salvation. There is no other way to God the Father in Heaven but through His Son Jesus Christ. Not Jesus and ______ (for example, Mary or Buddha or any other “saviors”). Not even Christ’s Church will save us, but Jesus Christ alone. So, while salvation is inclusively for all kinds of people, it is exclusively for those who believe in Christ alone."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Our faith is Christ-centered. Everything from beliefs, to doctrines, to practices and to commands all center around who Jesus Christ is and what He is for us who believe and love Him."+
