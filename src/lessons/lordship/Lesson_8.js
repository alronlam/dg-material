"<h3>LEAD ON</h3>" +
"What comes to mind when you hear the word “glory?”"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"God’s glory is sometimes hard to define. In the Bible, the word “glory” can mean brightness, honor, beauty, goodness, highness, greatness. All these can apply to God, only at a whole different level—the level of infinity. God is infinitely beautiful; God is infinitely great; God is therefore worthy of all honor."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"If God’s glory is difficult to define, it can be even more difficult to describe. God’s glory is so difficult to explain or put into words that probably the best way to understand it is to see it. Moses once asked the Lord for an experience of His glory. “Show me your glory” (see Exodus 33:18), he said. God granted his request, by making His glory (somehow) pass through Moses, as He proclaimed His name “the LORD” to him.  And what was Moses’ response? He could only bow his head towards the ground and worship (see Exodus 34:8)!"+
"So, what is God’s glory? We can say that God’s glory is the radiance of all the perfect things that make Him “God,” and His being worthy of all honor and worship."+


"<h3>OPEN WORD</h3>" +
"<b><i>Read Romans 11:36</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Read 1 Peter 4:11</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[11] whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Ultimately for God’s glory alone</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"This is Soli Deo Gloria: All things exist ultimately for God’s glory alone. All things created, in heaven, on earth, and everywhere else: from the greatest to the very least—all these are created for the glory of the Creator. Our thoughts, attitude and actions, therefore, must always be to glorify God in all things—from our salvation, to everything that He is to us, to our Christian life and service for Him. More than anything else in the world, we want to see God’s glory or make others see it. We must be driven by a desire for His glory because it is indeed our greatest good."+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Read Ephesians 2:8–9</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read 1 Corinthians 1:29–31</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[29] so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. [30] And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, [31] so that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read 2 Corinthians 4:4</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[4] In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>God’s glory in the Gospel of Christ</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Soli Deo Gloria is deeply rooted in the Gospel of salvation. The Bible says we have fallen short of God’s glory (see Romans 3:23). What this means is that we have become sinners. God’s glory is so high and so great and so holy that we don’t deserve to enjoy it or benefit from it in anyway in the first place because of our sinfulness."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"But out of God’s great love and abundant mercies He has saved us: by grace, through faith, in Jesus Christ.  It’s all gift. All God’s wisdom and power. All God’s doing. All Jesus Christ. We do not deserve it at all, so we can’t boast. We can’t steal any credit in our salvation. We can only boast in the Lord (1 Corinthians 1:29-31)."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"It’s no wonder, now, that the writer of Hebrews calls Jesus Christ the “radiance of the glory of God,” because, as he further explains, Jesus is also “the exact imprint of [God’s] nature.” He is God’s perfect image, and at the same time man’s perfect Savior (see Hebrews 2:5-18). Indeed, it is only proper to call the message of reconciliation, as Paul did, the “light of the gospel of the glory of Christ” (2 Corinthians 4:4)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 11:36 to 12:1</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[36] For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. [1] I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>God’s glory deserves and drives our worship</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"God’s glory drives us to worship, and the best way to express our worship is to offer our lives completely unto God. After discussing God’s most beautiful plan of salvation in Romans’ first eleven chapters, Paul concludes with a heartfelt doxology (11:36): To him be glory in all things forever! He then follows up with a call to action in the very next verse (12:1): Therefore, knowing that you were mercifully saved by God, bring glory to God by living a life of worship."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Everything we do must show how beautiful and great and awesome God is and what He has done, and that we would rather glorify Him than anything else. God’s glory must be our greatest value in life; the most important thing for us in this world. This is what living a life of worship means."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read 1 Corinthians 10:31</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Matthew 5:16</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Glorifying God in the sight of men</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Bringing glory to God also involves “third-party” observers: the people who watch your life. When Paul told the Corinthians to glorify God in all things, including drinking and eating, he said this in the context of food sacrificed to idols. The apostle said that it’s not that eating food sacrificed to idols or “gods” of other religions itself is sinful, but making those who see you eat it stumble in their faith. When Paul said “Whatever you do do it to the glory of God,” he actually meant to say that Christians must conduct themselves in such a way that God will be glorified by those who watch, especially in the eyes of unbelievers in hope that they will believe and be saved (see 1 Corinthians 10:33)."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"It’s good to be considerate of the people around you, especially those who do not have saving knowledge of Christ; as you live your life to God’s glory, you want them to do the same. You want them to praise and glorify your Father in heaven (not you!) as they see your good works and the outcome of your life of faith."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 12:2</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[2] Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Ephesians 5:10</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[10] and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Glorifying God is pleasing God</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Another simple way of understanding what “glorifying” God means is that, for us, it’s the same as pleasing Him. So, to glorify God means to make pleasing God our greatest pleasure. This means that we would rather please God than people, because you care more about God’s will than what people will say. Both Jesus and Paul talked about “receiving glory” from God instead of men (see John 5:41 and 1 Thessalonians 2:6). Of course, the Bible also teaches us to please other people as much as possible (see Romans 15:2; 1 Corinthians 10:33), but God’s approval must always trump human praise whenever they contradict."+


"<h3>LIVE OUT</h3>"+
"There is an unlimited number of ways to glorify God: with our lips when we sing in praise and worship, or even when we speak with words that honor God;  with our thoughts and feelings when we attune our minds and hearts to His will; with our actions when we do good works or avoid sinful or evil deeds. All these things—and a hundred million more—we can do to the glory of God. Is there ever a time when we are not in God’s immediate presence? So also must we make sure every single moment of our lives we live to glorify God."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Psalm 115:1</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[1] Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory,<br/>"+
"		for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness!</i>"+

"<br/><br/>"+
"Reflect: In what ways do you think you tend to rob God of the glory and worship which is due Him?"
