"<h3>LEAD ON</h3>" +
"Can you think of at least one instance when you had to choose to obey those in authority over you (parents, school, government, etc.) despite the fact that it was against your will? Why did you obey anyway?"+


"<h3>OPEN WORD</h3>" +
"<b><i>Read 1 Corinthians 15:1–4</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[1] Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, [2] and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. </i>"+
"<i>[3] For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, [4] that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Always going back to the Bible</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"At a point in time in the past, when virtually the whole Christian church was going further and further away from a biblical understanding of salvation, a rediscovery of the essential Gospel truths began happening when faithful men and women started going “back to the Bible.”"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"This chapter in church history (leading up to what’s called the Protestant Reformation) illustrates a very important lesson: If we neglect the Scriptures, we neglect the correct understanding of the Gospel. No Gospel, then, simply means no salvation."+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Read 2 Timothy 3:16</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[16] All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>The only word of God: uniqueness</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"The Bible is the only book in the world that is the very Word of God. No other book—no matter how godly or biblical its content is—can be considered to be on the same status. Only the Bible is inspired, or “breathed out,” by God. This makes Scripture the final and ultimate authority over all things concerning belief and practice. More specifically, the Bible is the only basis for everything we need to know concerning God’s salvation."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>The word of God alone: final authority</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"On this premise, we can safely say that no other book or source of information reveals to us purely and firsthand God’s amazing story and plan of salvation apart from the Bible. All other writings about the Gospel (like the one you are reading right now!) can and must only derive from what the Bible teaches."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"All the Solas of salvation, put together—Salvation is in Christ alone, given on the basis of grace alone, and received by faith alone, to the glory of God alone—are all doctrines that simply come from the Scriptures alone."+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Read Galatians 1:6–9</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[6] I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—[7] not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. [8] But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. [9] As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read 1 Timothy 1:3</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[3] As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Biblical, not just Bible-based</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Now, because the Scripture alone is the only ultimate basis for the truth of the Gospel, any other teaching or doctrine that does not agree with it is false. Jesus Christ and His Apostles have taught and delivered all things we need to know about salvation and the Christian life, and this we can access through Scripture alone. Any other teaching that adds/subtracts to or contradicts what has been taught in Scripture must be considered a false teaching/doctrine, and if it concerns salvation then a false gospel."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"So many doctrines are thought to be “based” on the Bible. However, the question is whether such doctrines represent what the bible really teaches. It’s not enough if a doctrine is bible-based—that it has been mentioned or has some sort of basis in the Bible. What we need is that our doctrines be biblical—that it is taught in the Bible as a whole as it is systematically understood, and explained correctly and clearly enough."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Remember: A teaching can be bible-based but not exactly biblical. For example, we can say that a lot of “Christian” cults’ teachings are “bible-based,” all because they include some elements—like events, ideas and themes—that are from the Bible. Some refer to Bible characters, even to Jesus Christ Himself. But the question is, Are the teachings consistent with what the whole Bible teaches? If not, then they are but Bible-based false teachings. They are what the Bible calls “twisted” or “perverted” teachings—they might sound correct, or true or good, but are actually none of those at all (see 2 Peter 3:16; Acts 20:30; Jude 1:3-4)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read 2 Timothy 2:15</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[15] Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>The Bible must be interpreted correctly</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"The overall message of the Bible is clear and simple enough for the common person to understand. However, some parts are more challenging to grasp the meaning of. The Bible, therefore, must be interpreted correctly, especially because interpreting Scripture correctly is essential in understanding the Gospel correctly."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Getting the correct interpretation isn’t just for the pastors, teachers and preachers; it’s for the members too. We see its importance in Paul’s words to Timothy in his second letter to him (2 Timothy 2:15). Now, we know that Paul’s letter is addressed to Timothy, who is a pastor. Although he instructs Timothy to “rightly handle the word of truth” as a pastor, we still get a sense of how important it is for every believer to hear the right interpretation, because if the pastor does it the wrong way then the members will also do the same. Everyone has to learn how to interpret the Bible correctly for themselves."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Scripture interprets Scripture</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"So, what should guide us in interpreting Scripture, especially its more difficult parts? Answer: the Scripture itself! The way to really understand one part of the Bible is to let the other parts explain it to you. Wondering what a particular verse means? Read the verses that went before it, and the ones that follow after it. If necessary, read the whole chapter, or the whole book. And if you really need to, then go through the whole Bible to see what other relevant verses and passages have to say."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"This is basically how the doctrine of Sola Scriptura works: It reminds us to simply let Scripture interpret Scripture. Doing this will not only help us understand the Bible, but will also open our eyes to see how all Scripture is united and will not contradict itself, because it was spoken by one and the same God (2 Timothy 3:16)."+

"<h3>LIVE OUT</h3>"+
"No matter how long a person has been a faithful disciple of Christ, he or she will always have something in his or her life that will need to be further submitted under the authority of God’s word and its teachings. Reflect: What areas of your life (think of at least one) do you think you need to work on submitting under the Lord’s will?"
