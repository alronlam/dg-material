"<h3>LEAD ON</h3>" +
"Injustice is rampant in society. Can you recall a recent/memorable story of injustice or a failure of the authorities or anyone involved to carry out justice?" +

"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>What is justification?</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Justification is the legal act of God to justify sinners, declaring them to be righteous in His sight. Being the Judge over all things created, he must declare whether each person is justified or condemned, innocent or guilty, according to what they deserve. Justification is the act by which a person, under legal proceedings, is pronounced to be innocent, free from guilt of any fault or wrongdoing, and so free from punishment."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"When God justified us, declaring us to be perfectly righteous in his sight, it’s not that we all of a sudden have stopped being sinners and have become morally perfect. It does mean that though we have sinned—and even continue to sin—we are now forgiven, and so not liable anymore to the penalty of our sins, past, present or future. In short, God has uncannily made us simul justus et peccator as said by Martin Luther, meaning “both just and sinners at the same time.”"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Sinners? Justified? It seems unthinkable to see these words joined together meaningfully. To justify sinners, on the face of it, doesn’t seem like a righteous thing to do. If a judge simply let’s the guilty go, then he himself must be senseless or evil, or both. What a terrible judge! However, we know God is not that kind of judge. He is neither evil, nor does He contradict Himself."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"So, how can a holy God let sinners like us go unpunished? Doesn’t God’s law itself condemn all sin and the sinners that commit them? (This is the message of most of the first three chapters of Romans.) And why is it that he not only “let us off the hook,” but also grants us with so much favor and blessing? The answer is God’s special work of justification. (“Special” because only He can do it.) "+

"<h3>OPEN WORD</h3>" +
"<b><i>Read Romans 3:22-26</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[21] But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—[22] the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: [23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, [25] whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. [26] It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Our Sin Problem and God’s Twofold Solution</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"As always, it all starts with our hopeless condition: We are all sinners (v23). God did not wait ‘til we’re perfectly righteous, because he would obviously have waited in vain. Instead, he prepared for us a righteousness that is not earned by us, but by His Son (vv21-22). Here’s how God did it: In Jesus Christ, He both cleared us of our guilt and credited righteousness to us."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 5:6,8</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[6] For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.</i>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[8] but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 8:3</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[3] For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin,he condemned sin in the flesh</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read 2 Corinthians 5:21</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[21] For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Our sins were imputed to Christ</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"First, our sins were credited to Jesus Christ so He could bear the punishment on the Cross on our behalf. This is also called the imputation of our sins to Christ. God dealt with Jesus as though our sins are his own, as though he was guilty of them, receiving the full brunt of the penalty. In this way, Jesus absorbed God’s righteous wrath for our sins, satisfying the holy God’s demand for justice and righteousness. Like fire that gets extinguished by water, so is God’s burning anger towards our sins satisfied by the blood of Jesus. This act of absorbing or appeasing the wrath of God is also called propitiation (see Romans 3:25-26)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 4:22–25</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"[22] That is why his faith was “counted to him as righteousness.” [23] But the words “it was counted to him” were not written for his sake alone, [24] but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord, [25] who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 5:19</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"[19] For as by the one man's [Adam’s] disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's [Jesus’] obedience the many will be made righteous."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Christ’s righteousness was imputed to us</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Second, Jesus Christ’s righteousness was credited to us. This act is called imputation of righteousness. Jesus’ righteous life on earth was made to count for those who will believe, and so earning for them the right to a favorable standing before a holy God. It’s not enough to be forgiven and be free from guilt, but we need to also have perfect record of obedience. This we receive from Jesus’ own record, being transferred to our account. "+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>The Great Exchange</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"The two imputations together are called the Great Exchange -- the merit of Jesus’s righteousness for the demerit of our sins. God is holy and in His wrath must punish sin, so He found a way to punish our sin and yet still forgive us, by providing Jesus to be our substitute, the only One worthy for and able to do the work. Also, this Substitute lived for us the perfect life we can never live, so we can appear before the Judge as though we have done all things that is required for us to enter and enjoy His holy presence. God knew no one would ever be able to earn their own favor in His sight, so He gave His Son, that whoever will have faith in this Son will receive all that the Son has earned for their sake."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"In the whole process, God is being perfectly just (see Romans 3:26). But in a sense, it is very unfair since we don’t deserve it at all. All grace. All gift (Ephesians 2:8)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>“Assurances” of justification</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Justification also means that the forgiven sinner is 100% free from the liability of paying for their sin. Not in part, but the whole, as the old hymn goes. No more condemnation. No more obstruction between the justified sinner and God (see Romans 8:1). By faith in Jesus Christ’s finished work, we can be fully trust on these “assurances”:"+
"<ul>"+
"<li>We are forever forgiven of sins (see 1 John 1:9); </li>"+
"<li>We are also forever clothed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ (see Isaiah 61:10); </li>"+
"<li>We are forever at peace and reconciled with the God who made our justification possible (see 2 Corinthians 5:17-21); </li>"+
"<li>We are forever confident that God’s favor will never leave us, because it doesn’t depend on whatever goodness or righteousness that we have in ourselves. It all rests in Christ’s perfect and finished work (see Romans 8:1-4).</li>"+
"</ul>"+




"<h3>LIVE OUT</h3>"+
"The doctrine of Justification is often used to wrongly justify persistence in sin and ungodly habits. But Paul himself knew what to say in response to this: "+
"<br/><br/>"+
"<i>“[1] What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? [2] By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? [3] Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? [4] We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. (Romans 6:1–4).”</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"In short, those who have been justified (forgiven) have also been regenerated (given new life, new power and new desires for a godly life). In what ways are you tempted to think that justification by faith is also an excuse to keep on sinning? You must say ‘no’ to these temptations and strive to live in holiness and godliness by God’s grace."
