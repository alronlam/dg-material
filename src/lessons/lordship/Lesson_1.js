"<h3>LEAD ON</h3>" +

"Terms to think through:" +
"<br/><br/>" +

"<b>Autonomy.</b> <i>self-directing freedom and especially moral independence (Merriam-Webster)</i>" +
"<br/>" +
"<b>Anarchy.</b> <i>a state of lawlessness or political disorder due to the absence of governmental authority (Merriam-Webster)</i>" +

"<br/><br/>" + 

"This present age we live in prides itself on preaching autonomy, the rule of the self. “You are your own master.” “Be true to yourself! Follow your heart!” But if we are our own king, then there’s no real standard of what’s right and wrong, because it’ll all vary according to each personal “kingdom.” Before you know it, autonomy has become anarchy—no rule at all." +

"<h3>OPEN WORD</h3>" +
"<b><i>Read Matthew 4:17</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[17] From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” </i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"<b><i>Read Matthew 28:18–20</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[18] And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. [19] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, [20] teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>It all starts with King Jesus</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"But Jesus, the true King, comes conquering. All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him, whether we acknowledge it or not. His holiness exposes sinfulness and neediness. His mercy extends with open arms to offer forgiveness and entrance into His Kingdom. His love invades and ravishes the soul so that all the soul could do is say, “Yes, my Lord. I am fully Yours.” Jesus is Master and Lord, and he commands us to repent and obey (see Acts 3:19, 20)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Repentance: turning away from sin</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"Jesus commands repentance. Repentance is the primary act of surrender to Who’s really King in the first place. It’s dethroning and discrowning yourself, bowing down in allegiance and awe of the Conqueror of your soul. It’s realizing the “sinfulness of sin” (see Romans 7:13) and the refusal to stay in bondage to it. Repentance, therefore, starts with a godly sorrow for having sinned against God (2 Corinthians 7:9, 10)."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"This also means turning away from everything that has to do with you being the center of your own universe; anything that promotes your selfishness—no matter how others-centered you think they are—all of these must go. You must turn your back against every sin. Every wrong thought, wrong word and wrong deed. This includes every inclination of the heart to love something or someone more than loving the Lord (see Matthew 22:37; Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27). Anything that leads you away from what’s best for you—that is, God himself—must be repented from."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"<i>Reflect: How would you describe the moment when you first realized that you are a sinner and your need for a Savior?</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Obedience: seeking to please the Lord out of love</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"Jesus commands obedience. This is at the core of what it means to be a disciple: doing (including teaching or promoting) all the things Jesus Christ commanded that we observe. It is your duty to know from God’s Word His perfect will in all areas of life, and to follow accordingly. Whatever Jesus commands, we obey."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Obedience starts with love (see John 14:15, 21 and 23). We obey not out of fear of judgment  but out of love for God and in gratitude for His mercy and grace (see 1 John 4:18). Even our very obedience—our ability to obey—is a product of God’s empowering grace (see 1 Corinthians 15:10). So we obey from grace and by grace."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"<i>Reflect: Obedience to parents works best if it comes from love. Describe how you are doing in terms of obeying your parents.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Sinless Perfection?</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"It doesn’t mean, though, that we must first be perfect with respect to repentance and obedience as a requirement. Perfection is the goal, yet it is not and can never be the prerequisite (remember: we are saved by grace alone, not by our own works)."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Repentance is more like an initial and unyielding declaration of war than an experience of final victory. Repentance is siding with Jesus, and relying on Him to be your strength in the fight against any traces of sin left in your life. We may lose some battles along the way, but through constant repentance, the war is a sure win for us. Same goes with obedience: It’s a decision of the heart, first in being willing to be baptized (see Acts 2:38), and then continuing on to a life of obedience to whatever pleases the Lord."+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Read Matthew 3:8</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Bear fruit in keeping with repentance."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"<b><i>Read Acts 26:20</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"[20] but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"<b><i>Read Matthew 7:19-21</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"[19] Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. [20] Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. [21] “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."+

"<h3>LIVE OUT</h3>"+
"<b><i>Evidence of being saved</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"You don’t just repent one time of your sins. You don’t stop with obeying the command to be baptized. You must make repentance of past and present sins and obedience of all of Jesus’ commands an “everyday thing” in your life. A Christian’s life must be marked by evidence of continuous repentance and obedience. If there is no evidence of these -- no “fruit” -- then the only reasonable conclusion is that you never were really a child of the King and a citizen of the Kingdom in the first place (see Matthew 7:22). Repentance and obedience, then, will always be a struggle; it is also a winning one, provided we stay struggling to the end."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"<i>How do you want to be prayed for in terms of your struggle with sin?</i>"
