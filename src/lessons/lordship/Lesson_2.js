"Being born again (also called  regeneration) is a mysterious, spiritual reality. Sadly, a lot of people do not really understand what it means to be born again, and often think that it is just a name for a specific group of Christians (as in “born again Christian,” compared to, say, Catholic Christian). Many people think they have been “born again” but actually have not. On the other hand, many have experienced it, though they haven’t heard about it yet."+

"<b><i>What is regeneration?</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Basically, regeneration is having a new spiritual life. It is being alive to things spiritual, to the things of the Spirit of God (see 1 Corinthians 2:12-14), that then leads to saving faith in Christ (see 1 John 5:1)."+

"<b><i>Read Ephesians 2:1–3</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—[3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. </i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+



"<b><i>All men are spiritually dead</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"Understanding it starts with the truth that all men are spiritually dead and blind because of sin and Satan (Ephesians 2:1-3; see also 2 Corinthians 4:4). The popular image of a zombie can be a good illustration for this: it walks and moves, and in some ways it seems alive, but it is basically dead. In the same way, persons who are not joined with Christ could be very physically alive, but will surely not have any personal knowledge of God, and no genuine desires to seek His Kingdom. So, the situation is hopeless...unless a miracle happens. This is where the miracle of the new birth comes in."+

"<b><i>Read John 3:1–12</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"[1] Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. [2] This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.” [3] Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” [4] Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?” [5] Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. [6] That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. [7] Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ [8] The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” [9] Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” [10] Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things? [11] Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. [12] If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?"+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Nicodemus , being a learned and intelligent man, still could not have a real sense of what being born again into the Kingdom of God is, since he himself had not yet been born again (John 3:1-12). He came to Jesus one night because he thought he was ready to understand what Jesus was all about, but then Jesus himself shows him that he really wasn’t, by showing him that he couldn’t even understand what the new birth is. He wanted to understand it, but his mind was stuck with earthly metaphors (of physical birth, of water and of wind), and could not move on to seeing the heavenly truths behind them. This must have really frustrated Nicodemus at this point, but there’s simply nothing he could do about it."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"The day you were born is the day your life started. So also it is with the spiritual life: It starts with being born again, not physically, but spiritually. It is the birth of the new you—a new creation, a new beginning. It’s like being awake to a whole new world of being a child of God. This is why regeneration is often symbolized by water, because the Holy Spirit, like water, washes and renews (See Titus 3:5-6; John 3:5). This also means that no one is born a believer, even if they’re born of religious and genuinely believing parents. A second birth (“born again”) is necessary. But how does it come about?"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Regeneration comes through the preaching of the Gospel</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"Regeneration only comes through the preaching of the Gospel (see 1 Peter 1:23, 25). The good news of salvation in the person and work of Christ, explained clearly enough and understood correctly is the way through which God regenerates individuals. There is no other way to experience being born again apart from understanding God’s way of salvation in Christ. You are not regenerated just because you felt a certain emotional feeling during a worship service, or simply because you were dipped in or sprinkled with water ceremonially. Even being religious won’t bring new birth! It comes only when a person encounters Jesus through the Gospel."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Regeneration is the work of God alone</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"Regeneration is the work of God alone (see John 1:12-13; 3:1-8; 1 Peter 1:3). Nature itself proves that no person has ever birthed himself or herself into existence. Being born again, in the same way, all depends on the will and power of God through His Spirit, to make those dead in sin to be alive in Christ. No one is born again out of their own effort or somebody else’s. You can’t force it. It’s all God’s sovereign initiative and love that makes regeneration possible (see Ephesians 2:4-6)."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"Regeneration happens prior to the first time we practice faith and repentance. In fact, we can’t believe or repent of our sins without first being made alive by the Spirit. How can a spiritually dead person experience sorrow for his or her sins and respond to the Gospel, unless the Spirit first gives him or her life to experience it?  Being born again does not rely on our response to the Gospel, but we respond to it because we have first been born again (see 1 John 5:1)."+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Regeneration comes with a new heart</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Regeneration comes with new desires. God gives us a new heart, and puts His Spirit in us, so that we can live according to His will (see Ezekiel 36:24-28). This is why we are regenerated before faith and repentance: The new heart and God’s Spirit must first be given to us before we can believe, hate sin, repent of our wrongdoings and lead a life of obedience. Before being born again, we are simply self-centered rebels, dead to sin; after regeneration, we suddenly taste and see the Lord’s goodness and are forever changed (though not yet perfectly)."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"The new birth is a profound truth that is at the center of God’s new creation work in every true Christian. It will bring great blessing for the believer to understand the inner-workings of this new spiritual life in order to live in accordance with it."+
