"Fun question: If you could choose just one thing that you can get for free and in unlimited amounts everyday of your life, what would it be and why?"+


"<h3>OPEN WORD</h3>" +
"<b><i>Read Ephesians 2:1–10</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[1] And you were dead in the trespasses and sins [2] in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—[3] among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. [4] But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, [5] even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—[6] and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, [7] so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. [8] For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, [9] not a result of works, so that no one may boast. [10] For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. </i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>The beauty of God’s grace</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"Jesus worked for our salvation, and we receive it from God as an undeserved gift. The Bible shows us what grace means by painting this beautiful picture. Sadly, the beauty of God’s grace that has amazed the world through the centuries has worn out in the eyes of many, all because they have misunderstood it in one way or another. The doctrine of Sola Gratia helps us keep ourselves on the right track, by reminding us—and this is where it should all start—that the only way anyone can be saved is by grace alone."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 3:23–24</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 6:23</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[23] For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Romans 5:8</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[8] but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+



"<b><i>Grace is free and undeserved</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Grace is free. We didn’t work for it to earn it, because we simply can’t. It can only be freely given. We cannot rely on ourselves to gain God’s favor, or save ourselves from the penalty of our sins. Grace is merit earned not by us, though for us."+
"<br/><br/>"+
"So, by definition, grace is favor or blessing that is undeserved. If you think that you deserve God’s salvation then it means you have not really understood the Gospel and therefore are not a true believer. What’s worse than being a person who believes he’s “met the requirements,” who thinks he has on his own pleased God enough to consider him worthy of Heaven? Not only will such a person miss out on God’s saving grace, but he will also be so self-righteous that he’ll probably be the last person anyone would like to be around with."+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Read Romans 11:5–6</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[5] So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. [6] But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. </i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read John 1:12–13</i></b>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[12] But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, [13] who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Grace is sovereign</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"God’s grace is also sovereign, meaning it all depends on God’s choosing. It must be, “otherwise grace would no longer be grace” said the Apostle Paul. God’s sovereign grace is most evident in regeneration. First, we know it was God’s work alone to make us spiritually alive (see Ephesians 2:4-6). We were born again right when we didn’t have any ability at all to free ourselves from our helplessness (see John 3:1-12), being dead in sin (see Ephesians 2:1). Dead people can’t do anything to change their condition. That’s why when we were dead in our sins, the Spirit overpowered our deadness and gave us a new heart that beats for the Lord and for His Kingdom. This is God’s sovereign grace: giving life to the dead so that they can believe and be saved."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Grace is daily and unlimited</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Sola Gratia also reminds us that, not only is our salvation all by God’s grace, but also every bit of our life must be lived by the power of God’s grace. We can do nothing without Christ, but in Him we can do all things (see John 15:5 and Philippians 4:13). By His grace alone we become strong even in our weaknesses, because it is the power of Christ that rests upon us and works through us (see 2 Corinthians 12:9-10). By His grace alone we do great and praiseworthy things for His glory, because it’s His grace that is at work in us (see 1 Corinthians 15:10)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Grace produces fruits of good works</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Grace produces good works (Ephesians 2:10), not the other way around; God’s grace is free, but it necessarily comes with the “overflow” of works of righteousness. As God’s grace begins its good work in us, it then produces fruits of good works to the glory and praise of God. Grace trains us to turn away from ungodliness and to embrace godliness (see Titus 2:11-12)."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read James 4:6</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[6] But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read 1 Peter 5:5</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>[5] Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+


"<b><i>Grace humbles us</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"Finally, grace humbles. If there is anything that grace must do to us is that it should make us realize—let this sink in!—that the Creator is also our great Lover and Redeemer, filthy as we are because of sin. And God gives even more grace, for the more we humble ourselves the more grace God provides for us. So we get caught in a “blessed cycle”—grace causing humility in us, which then begets more grace."+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read 2 Peter 3:18</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Read Ephesians 1:6</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"<i>to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved.</i>"+
"<br/><br/>"+

"<b><i>Growth in God’s Grace</b></i>"+
"<br/>"+
"As a fitting response, you must keep on growing in God’s grace by increasingly realizing how much you need it every second of your life. Also, we give glory to our God who gives overflowing grace. The old hymn still rings true: “Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me!” The Christian just can’t help but keep singing this in their heart whenever they think about how much God has blessed them undeservingly. Praise be to God’s glorious grace!"+
