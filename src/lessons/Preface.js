"This life that we receive in Christ flows from Him, through us and to every aspect of our lives. We, Christians, will do well only if we make a habit of cultivating this life. This is why we have this as our aim: to live the Gospel-centered Christian life, and live it abundantly, by the power of His Spirit. Thus, we have planned and traced the paths for our discipleship journey with this aim in mind. This discipleship journey is one that ends only in eternity, when we finally get to see and be with our Lord and Savior." +

"We have arranged a series of lessons – a discipleship roadmap – to aid us in our pursuit. The series of lessons are designed to present to us what God has said in His Word, in an order that follows the different phases of the journey. Most importantly, each lesson’s content belabors to point us to a Gospel-centered, life-enriching understanding of God’s Word and its practical implications to daily living."
